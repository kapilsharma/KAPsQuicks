# Create new React project

We will use Vite, which is defacto standard now a days.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

After that, follow on-screen instructions. Questions are

- Project name: Enter your project name
- Package name: Needed for package.json
- Framework: React
- Variant: JavaScript (Or cna choose TypeScript too)

After that, we need to go to project folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then we cna do `npm run dev` to run project locally.
