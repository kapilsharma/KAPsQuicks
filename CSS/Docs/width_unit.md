# Font size

Recommended rem
Relative to root element (html) which is by default is 16 pixel mostly.
We prefer that as we may want to respect browser settings is users.

> Trick: We can set `font-size: 62.5%` at html element. This will make font size to 10 pixel. Now 2.1 rem (say) will give font-size of 21 pixel.
