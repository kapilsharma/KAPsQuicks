# CSS

These are not complete CSS notes. I'm working on CSS since 20+ years and remember most of the common properties by heart.

I'll be listing only some CSS3 things, that I didn't worked a lot with or had some confusion. So this is just my notes while having quick lookup to solve those confusions.
