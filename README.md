# KAPsQuicks

My quick notes on different programming languages. Supposed for self-consumption but anyone is free to check, if it helps.

It is licenced under [MIT license](LICENSE), which seems most permissive. In short, you are free to do whatever you want to do with this repository.

# Contribution

You are most welcome! I'll thankfully accept contribution in two forms

- Notes on language not listed (with 100% recognition to you)
- Corrections in already added notes

I could be reluctant in following contributions

- Adding to notes already published.

The Reason is, if I already started adding some notes, I've some plans to keep adding to them. If your contribution does not match that plan, I might not accept the PR. So if you plan to add docs to already added notes, please connect with me first so that we can plan better.
