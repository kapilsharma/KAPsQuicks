# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Complexity

- [BigO Notation](./Docs/big_o.md)

## Data Structure

- Primitive (Provided by most languages out of the box)
  - Integer
  - Float
  - Character
    - String
  - Boolean
  - Pointer: By C/C++, stores memory address
- [Linear Data Structure](./Docs/10_linear_ds.md)
  - [Array](./Docs/11_array.md)
  - [Linked List](./Docs/12_linked_list.md)
    - Singly Linked list
    - Doubly Linked list
    - Circular Linked list
  - Stack (Last in, first out)
  - Queues (First in, first out)
    - Simple queue (FIFO)
    - Circular queue
    - Priority Queue: Dequeued based on priority, not order.
    - Deque (Allow operation at both end - Sliding window algorithm)
- Non-linear Data Structure
  - Tree - Used for hierarchical data, search, indexing
    - Binary Trees
      - Binary Search Tree (Left child < parent < Right child)
    - B-Trees: Optimized for storage, mostly used in DB
    - Heap
  - Graph
    - Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have the direction
    - Undirected Graph: Edges have weight
  - Hash-based Data Structure
    - Hash table
    - Hash Map
    - Hash Set
