# Java Script

There are too many forntend and backend JS frameworks. However, these notes are specific to Java Script or ECMA Script.

Even Type Script is not covered here, we will have separate notes for TypeScript.

> [!importnat] These notes are useful for someone who have very good programming knowledge in any programming language and want to quickly start with Python.
>
> My main goal of writing these notes is to remind me hte concepts, when needed, as I frequently switch between Programming languages.

Also, these notes have example that run in node environment, but they should also work in browser.

## ES Docs

ECMA Script (Short ES) is a standardized scripting language specifications published by <a href="https://ecma-international.org/" target="_blank">ECMA International</a>. It serves as the foundation for sevaral scripting languages like JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.

However, now a days, JScript and ActionScript are not much in use so most people interchangably use ES and JS as synomyms.
